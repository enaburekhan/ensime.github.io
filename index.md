ENSIME was a project that lasted for 9 years from 2010 to 2019 and took contributions from hundreds of contributors. ENSIME pioneered community oriented development in the Scala community and was one of the first communities to introduce a code of conduct.

In 2018, the Scala Center chose to fund a from-scratch competitor to ENSIME rather than take over maintenance, named [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/), that makes this project irrelevant.

Everybody is encouraged to use Metals instead of ENSIME, which is no longer active.
