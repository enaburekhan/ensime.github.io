ENSIME was a Scala tooling project that lasted for ten years (2010 to 2019) and brought together hundreds of Free Software contributors from diverse backgrounds.

ENSIME pioneered community-oriented development in the Scala community and was one of the first communities to introduce a code of conduct.

In 2018, the Scala Center chose to fund a from-scratch competitor named [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/). As a result, ENSIME is no longer relevant.

Users are encouraged to install Metals.

Contributors are encouraged to do something else with their precious time: be with family or just spend time surrounded by nature. You will not find happiness by engaging with the Open Source community; only exploitation and politics. If you insist on getting involved, please [do not use your real name](https://medium.com/@fommil/hide-your-real-name-in-open-source-3d67e74a8c56).
